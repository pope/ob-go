;;; Commentary:

;; Org-Babel support for evaluating go code.
;;
;; Much of this is modeled after `ob-C'. Just like the `ob-C', you can specify
;; :flags headers when compiling with the "go run" command. Unlike `ob-C', you
;; can also specify :args which can be a list of arguments to pass to the
;; binary. If you quote the value passed into the list, it will use `ob-ref'
;; to find the reference data.
;;
;; If you do not include a main function or a package name, `ob-go' will
;; provide it for you and it's the only way to properly use
;;
;; very limited implementation:
;; - currently only support :results output.
;; - not much in the way of error feedback.
;; - cannot handle table or list input.

;;; Requirements:

;; - You must have go1 installed and the go should be in your `exec-path'. If
;;   not, feel free to modify `org-babel-go-command' to the location of your
;;   go command.
;;
;; - `go-mode' is also recommended for syntax highlighting and
;;   formatting. Not this particularly needs it, it just assumes you
;;   have it.

;;; TODO:

;; - Provide better error feedback.
;;
;; - Figure out a nice way to handle lists and tables.
;;
;; - Do some simple parsing of the go code to insert vars right after the
;;   package declaration.

;;; Code:
